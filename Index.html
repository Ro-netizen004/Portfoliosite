        <h1>About <span class="ColorChange">Me</span></h1>
         <p>Currently, I'm immersing myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, honing my skills to build dynamic and responsive websites.
                I'm also exploring various frameworks and libraries to enhance my development capabilities. My goal is to continually evolve as a developer, 
                taking on challenging projects that help me grow and make an impact.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to web development, I'm expanding my knowledge of Python and have started creating simple projects with it.
                Outside of coding, I enjoy painting, experimenting with animation, and binge-watching horror movies on Netflix. Originally from Bangladesh, 
                I moved to the University of South Florida in Fall 2024 to pursue my passion for technology and innovation.

        <h1><span class="ColorChange">My</span> Works</h1>
        <p>Not much to see here. Currently I'm learning about html, css and js. This portfolio is the biggest project I've worked on yet. I made a simple rock paper scissor game with Python
            and a to-do list task application. The detailed code to these projects can be found in my github linked on the home page. I'll keep adding my projects here as I make them, and hopefully this section won't be so empty anymore.
